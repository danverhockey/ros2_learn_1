This is code I generated as a part of taking the Udemy course, "ROS2 For Beginners (ROS Foxy, Humble - 2024)" by Edouard Renard. 

The final class project is encapsulated in, "turtlesim_catch_them_all_pkg". The objective was to create a package that interacted with the turtlesim simulator with two nodes, one responsible for spawning random turtles and another to control the main turtle to capture them. This is my completed attempt at the final project.
